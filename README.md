> Special note for this chapter:
We only went over SELECT and INSERT INTO to select new records and create a new record, respectively. This can be completed later, but it is preferred to explain that it will be easier to use sequelize to prevent relational database issues. This will happen as we create relationships between tables such as products and cart, for example.

See the next chapter for the preferred method with sequelize.
